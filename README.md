This app is made using flask framework. 
All the required libraries are mentioned in the 'requirements.txt' file. Also latest python version don't support tensorflow. So use old python version (like 3.9.x , where you can vary x Or 3.11.x will also work I guess, but not sure.) 
You can use versions which is suitable for your system.
